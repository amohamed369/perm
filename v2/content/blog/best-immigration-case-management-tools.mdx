## The Landscape

Immigration law practices have more software options than ever. From all-in-one case management platforms to specialized tools for specific visa categories, the market has matured significantly. Here's an honest look at the major players.

## General Immigration Case Management

### INSZoom

The enterprise standard for large immigration practices and corporate immigration departments.

**Best for**: Large firms, corporate immigration teams, multi-office practices
**Strengths**: Comprehensive case tracking, compliance tools, government processing integration, robust reporting
**Considerations**: Higher cost, longer implementation timeline, steeper learning curve
**Pricing**: Custom enterprise pricing

### Docketwise

A modern, forms-focused immigration platform that streamlines the preparation and filing of immigration forms.

**Best for**: Solo practitioners and small firms focused on form preparation
**Strengths**: Smart form filling, questionnaire-based intake, client portal, clean interface
**Considerations**: Less focused on deadline tracking, more oriented toward form preparation
**Pricing**: Starting at $69/month

### LawLogix (now Hyland)

Long-established immigration case management with compliance features.

**Best for**: Mid-size to large firms needing compliance tracking
**Strengths**: I-9 compliance, E-Verify integration, case management, government processing times
**Considerations**: Interface can feel dated, pricing can be significant
**Pricing**: Custom pricing

## PERM-Specific Tools

### PERM Tracker

A free, purpose-built tool specifically for PERM labor certification case tracking.

**Best for**: Any practice handling PERM cases, regardless of size
**Strengths**: Automated deadline calculation based on 20 CFR 656, recruitment tracking, notification system, visual timeline and calendar, completely free
**Considerations**: PERM-focused only (not a general immigration case manager), newer to market
**Pricing**: Free

## Practice Management (with Immigration Features)

### Clio

General legal practice management that can be adapted for immigration work.

**Best for**: Firms needing billing, timekeeping, and case management in one platform
**Strengths**: Industry-standard practice management, integrations ecosystem, billing
**Considerations**: Not immigration-specific, requires customization for immigration workflows
**Pricing**: Starting at $49/month

### MyCase

Another general practice management tool used by some immigration practices.

**Best for**: Small firms wanting an all-in-one solution
**Strengths**: Client portal, billing, document management
**Considerations**: Immigration workflows require manual setup
**Pricing**: Starting at $39/month

## How to Choose

The right tool depends on your practice:

| Practice Type | Recommended Approach |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Solo, PERM-focused | PERM Tracker (free) + Clio for billing |
| Solo, general immigration | Docketwise or Clio |
| Small firm (2-10 attorneys) | Docketwise + PERM Tracker for PERM cases |
| Mid-size firm | LawLogix or INSZoom |
| Corporate immigration department | INSZoom |
| High-volume PERM practice | PERM Tracker + Docketwise for forms |

## Key Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating tools, consider:

1. **Automation** — Does it calculate deadlines or just store them?
2. **Notifications** — Will it proactively alert you to approaching deadlines?
3. **Compliance** — Does it validate against current regulations?
4. **Integration** — Does it work with your existing tools?
5. **Cost** — Does the pricing make sense for your practice size?
6. **Support** — Is help available when you need it?

## Conclusion

The best immigration case management approach often involves multiple specialized tools rather than one monolithic platform. Use the best tool for each aspect of your practice — forms, deadlines, billing, compliance — and ensure they work together.

The most important thing is not which tool you choose, but that you have a reliable system in place. Missed deadlines and compliance gaps don't care which software you're using.
