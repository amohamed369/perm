## Understanding PERM Audits

A PERM audit occurs when the Department of Labor selects an application for additional review. This typically adds 6-12 months to the processing timeline and requires the employer to submit supporting documentation.

While audits can be random, certain application characteristics increase the likelihood of selection. Understanding these triggers helps attorneys prepare better applications and set realistic client expectations.

## Trigger 1: Unusual Job Requirements

The DOL scrutinizes job requirements that appear tailored to a specific candidate. If the minimum requirements exceed what's normally required for similar positions, expect an audit.

**Common red flags:**
- Requiring specific technologies that are uncommon in the field
- Experience requirements exceeding the SVP level for the occupation
- Dual degree requirements without clear business justification
- Combinations of skills that are unusually specific

**How to avoid it:**
- Ensure requirements align with the O*NET job zone for the occupation
- Document genuine business necessity for any above-normal requirements
- Review comparable job postings to benchmark requirements

## Trigger 2: Foreign Language Requirements

Requiring fluency in a language other than English almost always triggers an audit. The DOL wants to ensure this isn't a mechanism to limit the applicant pool.

**How to avoid it:**
- Only require foreign language skills when there's a genuine business need
- Prepare detailed business necessity documentation
- Document the percentage of clients or business conducted in the language
- Consider whether the requirement can be listed as preferred rather than required

## Trigger 3: Related Employer-Beneficiary Relationships

When the beneficiary has a familial, ownership, or other close relationship with the employer, the DOL will want to verify that the recruitment was genuine.

**Common scenarios:**
- Family-owned businesses sponsoring a family member
- Beneficiary who is a partial owner of the company
- Small businesses where the beneficiary plays a key role

**How to avoid it:**
- Conduct thorough, well-documented recruitment
- Maintain detailed records of all applicants and interview notes
- Ensure the recruitment process is genuinely open to U.S. workers

## Trigger 4: Recruitment Documentation Gaps

Inadequate or inconsistent recruitment documentation is a frequent audit trigger. The DOL expects complete records of every recruitment step.

**What the DOL looks for:**
- Proof of all required recruitment activities
- Complete records of applicant responses
- Documentation of why U.S. applicants were rejected (if any)
- Consistency between the job posting and the ETA 9089

**How to avoid it:**
- Create a recruitment file checklist before starting
- Save copies of all advertisements, job orders, and postings
- Document every applicant interaction with dates and outcomes
- Ensure job descriptions are consistent across all recruitment materials

## Trigger 5: Timing Issues

The DOL pays close attention to the timing of recruitment activities. Filing too early or too late relative to recruitment activities can trigger an audit.

**Key timing rules:**
- Recruitment must be completed within 180 days before filing
- The earliest recruitment activity must be no more than 180 days before filing
- There must be a 30-day "cooling off" period after recruitment ends

**How to avoid it:**
- Create a detailed timeline before starting recruitment
- Track all dates carefully using dedicated tools
- Build in buffer time between recruitment end and filing

## Best Practices for Audit Preparedness

Even with careful preparation, audits can happen. Being prepared is the best defense:

1. **Maintain complete files** — Keep copies of everything from day one
2. **Respond promptly** — You typically have 30 days to respond to an audit
3. **Be thorough** — Provide more documentation than required, not less
4. **Track deadlines** — Missing an audit response deadline results in automatic denial

## Conclusion

While PERM audits add time and complexity, they're manageable with proper preparation. The key is thorough documentation, genuine recruitment efforts, and careful attention to timing — from the very start of the process.
