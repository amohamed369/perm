## Current PERM Processing Times

As of early 2026, the Department of Labor is processing PERM applications within approximately **8 to 14 months** from the date of filing. This represents a continued improvement from the significant backlogs experienced in 2023-2024.

However, processing times vary significantly based on several factors:

- **Case complexity** — Simple cases move faster than those requiring additional review
- **Audit selection** — Cases selected for audit can add 6-12 months
- **Filing volume** — Seasonal fluctuations affect processing speed
- **Staffing levels** — DOL staffing changes impact throughput

## Stage-by-Stage Timeline

Here's what attorneys should plan for across the full PERM process:

| Stage | Estimated Time | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| PWD Request | 6-12 months | NPWC processing |
| Recruitment | 2-3 months | Including 30-day posting periods |
| Cooling Off | 30+ days | After recruitment ends |
| ETA 9089 Filing | 1 day | Electronic filing |
| DOL Processing | 8-14 months | Current estimates |
| I-140 Filing | Within 180 days | After certification |

**Total estimated time**: 18-36 months from initiation to I-140 filing.

## Factors That Affect Your Timeline

### PWD Processing

The National Prevailing Wage Center (NPWC) has its own processing timeline, which is independent of the PERM application itself. PWD requests currently take 6-12 months, and the resulting determination is valid for one year.

<Callout type="warning" title="PWD Expiration Risk">
If the PWD expires before you file the ETA 9089, you'll need to request a new determination — potentially adding another 6-12 months. Track your PWD expiration date carefully.
</Callout>

### Audit Risk

Approximately 30-40% of PERM applications are selected for audit. Common audit triggers include:

- Job requirements that exceed the norm for the occupation
- Business necessity letters for unusual requirements
- Foreign language requirements
- Employee-owned businesses
- Related employer-beneficiary relationships

### Supervised Recruitment

In some cases, the DOL may require supervised recruitment, which involves the DOL overseeing the recruitment process. This can add significant time to the process.

## Strategies for Managing Timelines

### 1. Start PWD Early

File the PWD request as early as possible. Since it can take 6-12 months and expires after one year, timing is critical.

### 2. Prepare Recruitment Materials in Advance

Have your recruitment materials ready to launch as soon as the PWD is received. Every day saved in preparation reduces the risk of PWD expiration.

### 3. Track Everything

Use a systematic tracking approach to monitor all deadlines across your active cases. Tools like PERM Tracker can automate deadline calculation and send advance notifications.

### 4. Build in Buffer Time

Don't plan to file on the last possible day. Build in buffer time for unexpected delays, document gathering, and attorney review.

## Historical Trends

Processing times have fluctuated significantly over the past five years:

- **2021**: 6-8 months (post-pandemic catch-up)
- **2022**: 8-10 months (increasing volume)
- **2023**: 12-18 months (significant backlog)
- **2024**: 10-16 months (gradual improvement)
- **2025**: 8-14 months (continued improvement)
- **2026**: 8-14 months (current estimates)

## Conclusion

While PERM processing times have improved, the overall timeline remains lengthy. Proactive planning, early initiation, and meticulous deadline tracking remain the best strategies for successful PERM case management.
