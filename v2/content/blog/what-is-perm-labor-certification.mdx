## What is PERM?

PERM stands for **Program Electronic Review Management**, the system used by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to process applications for permanent labor certification. It is a critical first step in the employment-based green card process for many foreign workers.

The PERM process requires employers to demonstrate that there are no qualified, willing, and available U.S. workers for the position being offered to a foreign national. This is done through a structured recruitment process and the filing of an ETA Form 9089.

## Why Does PERM Matter?

For most employment-based second preference (EB-2) and third preference (EB-3) green card categories, PERM labor certification is a mandatory prerequisite. Without an approved PERM application, the employer cannot proceed with the I-140 immigrant petition.

The stakes are high: a single missed deadline or procedural misstep can result in denial, audit, or the need to restart the entire process — potentially adding years to a client's immigration timeline.

## The Five Stages of PERM

The PERM process can be broken down into five distinct stages:

### 1. Prevailing Wage Determination (PWD)

Before any recruitment can begin, the employer must obtain a prevailing wage determination from the DOL's National Prevailing Wage Center (NPWC). This establishes the minimum salary that must be offered for the position.

- **Processing time**: Currently 6–12 months
- **Validity**: 1 year from determination date (with possible 1-year extension under certain conditions)

### 2. Recruitment

Once the PWD is obtained, the employer must conduct a series of recruitment activities to test the U.S. labor market. The required activities include:

- Job order with the State Workforce Agency (SWA) for 30 days
- Two Sunday newspaper advertisements
- 30-day posting of the internal job notice
- Three additional recruitment steps (from a list of 10 options)

All recruitment must be completed within 180 days before filing the PERM application.

### 3. ETA Form 9089 Filing

After the recruitment period, the employer prepares and files the ETA Form 9089 electronically through the DOL's PERM system. This form includes details about the job, the employer, and the foreign worker.

### 4. DOL Review

The DOL reviews the application and may:

- **Certify** the application (approval)
- **Issue an audit** requesting additional documentation
- **Deny** the application

### 5. I-140 Petition

Upon certification, the employer has 180 days to file the I-140 immigrant petition with USCIS. This is a strict deadline — missing it means the PERM certification expires.

## Common Pitfalls

Immigration attorneys should be vigilant about these frequent issues:

- **Expired PWD**: Filing after the prevailing wage determination has expired
- **Recruitment timing**: Not completing all recruitment within the required window
- **I-140 deadline**: Missing the 180-day filing window after certification
- **Documentation gaps**: Insufficient records of recruitment activities for audit response

## How PERM Tracker Helps

Managing multiple PERM cases simultaneously means tracking dozens of interconnected deadlines across different stages. PERM Tracker automates deadline calculation, sends advance notifications, and provides a clear visual timeline of each case's progress.

## Key Regulations

The PERM process is governed by:

- **20 CFR Part 656** — The primary regulation governing labor certification
- **ETA Form 9089** — The application form for permanent labor certification
- **Training and Employment Guidance Letters (TEGLs)** — DOL policy guidance

## Conclusion

PERM labor certification is a complex but navigable process when approached systematically. Understanding the five stages, their interconnected deadlines, and common pitfalls is essential for any immigration attorney handling employment-based cases.

The key to success is meticulous deadline tracking, thorough documentation, and proactive case management — whether done manually or with purpose-built tools like PERM Tracker.
