## Why Recruitment Tracking Matters

The recruitment phase is the most documentation-intensive part of the PERM process. Missing even one required activity can result in denial. PERM Tracker's recruitment tracking ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

## The Required Activities

Every PERM case requires a minimum set of recruitment activities. PERM Tracker provides a built-in checklist that tracks:

### Mandatory (All Cases)

1. **SWA Job Order** — 30-day posting with the State Workforce Agency
2. **Newspaper Ad #1** — Sunday edition, area of intended employment
3. **Newspaper Ad #2** — Sunday edition (different date)
4. **Internal Job Posting** — 10 consecutive business days at the worksite

### Professional Occupations (3 Additional Required)

For positions requiring a bachelor's degree or higher, select and track three additional activities from the approved list.

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Case

Open the case that's entering the recruitment stage. Click on the **Recruitment** section.

### Step 2: Enter Activity Dates

For each recruitment activity, enter:
- **Start date** — When the activity began
- **End date** — When the activity concluded (if applicable)
- **Notes** — Publication name, job order number, website URL, etc.

### Step 3: Track Completion

As each activity is completed, check it off in the recruitment checklist. The system will:
- Validate that all required activities are present
- Check that timing requirements are met (e.g., 30-day SWA posting)
- Calculate the earliest possible filing date based on activity dates
- Flag any gaps or timing issues

### Step 4: Review the Recruitment Summary

Before filing, review the recruitment summary to confirm:
- All required activities are complete
- The filing date falls within the 180-day window
- The 30-day cooling-off period has elapsed
- No timing conflicts exist

Save copies of all recruitment materials (ads, postings, emails) in your case file alongside your PERM Tracker records. Digital records complement — but don't replace — your physical documentation.

## Common Recruitment Mistakes

1. **Starting recruitment before PWD** — All recruitment must occur after the PWD is received
2. **Insufficient newspaper ads** — Must be two separate Sunday editions
3. **SWA duration** — Must remain active for the full 30 days
4. **Missing additional steps** — Professional occupations need three extras, not two
5. **Filing too soon** — The 30-day cooling-off period is mandatory

## Best Practices

- **Enter dates immediately** — Don't wait until filing to update your records
- **Use the notes field** — Record publication names, URLs, and confirmation numbers
- **Check the validation** — Let the system catch timing issues before you file
- **Export for audit prep** — Keep a recruitment summary ready in case of audit
