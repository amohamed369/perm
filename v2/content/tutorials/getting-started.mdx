## Welcome to PERM Tracker

PERM Tracker is a free case management tool built specifically for immigration attorneys handling PERM labor certification cases. This tutorial will walk you through everything you need to start tracking your cases effectively.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

Head to [permtracker.app/signup](/signup) and create your account using Google Sign-In or email. The process takes less than 30 seconds.

Once signed in, you'll land on your **Dashboard** — the central hub for all your PERM cases.

## Step 2: Create Your First Case

Click the **"New Case"** button on your Dashboard or Cases page. You'll need to provide:

- **Beneficiary name** — The foreign worker's name
- **Company name** — The sponsoring employer
- **Case stage** — Where the case currently stands (PWD, Recruitment, ETA 9089, I-140)

That's all you need to get started. You can add more details as the case progresses.

## Step 3: Enter Key Dates

The real power of PERM Tracker comes from its deadline calculation engine. As you enter dates, the system automatically calculates:

- **PWD expiration** — When the prevailing wage determination expires
- **Recruitment windows** — When recruitment activities must be completed
- **Filing deadlines** — When the ETA 9089 must be filed
- **I-140 deadline** — The 180-day window after certification

Simply enter dates as they become available, and PERM Tracker handles the math.

<Callout type="tip" title="Cascade Updates">
When you change a key date like the PWD determination date, all dependent deadlines — expiration, filing windows, I-140 deadline — recalculate automatically. No manual math required.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Track Recruitment Activities

For cases in the Recruitment stage, PERM Tracker provides a built-in checklist of required recruitment activities:

- SWA job order (30 days)
- Two Sunday newspaper ads
- Internal job posting (30 days)
- Three additional recruitment steps

Check off each activity as it's completed. The system validates that all requirements are met before you can proceed.

## Step 5: Set Up Notifications

Never miss a deadline again. PERM Tracker offers multiple notification channels:

- **Email alerts** — Sent days before deadlines
- **Push notifications** — Real-time browser notifications
- **Dashboard warnings** — Visual urgency indicators on your case cards

Configure your notification preferences in **Settings** to choose which alerts you receive and how far in advance.

## Step 6: Use the Calendar & Timeline

Two powerful views help you manage your caseload:

- **Calendar** — See all deadlines across all cases in a familiar calendar format
- **Timeline** — A Gantt-chart style view showing case progression and overlapping deadlines

These views make it easy to spot conflicts and plan your workload.

## What's Next?

Now that you're set up, explore these features:

- **Cascade updates** — When you change a key date, dependent deadlines update automatically
- **Validation warnings** — The system flags potential issues before they become problems
- **AI assistant** — Ask questions about PERM regulations directly in the app
