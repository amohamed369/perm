## Why Deadline Tracking Matters

In PERM practice, missing a single deadline can mean:

- **Expired PWD** — Must restart the prevailing wage process (6-12 months lost)
- **Missed filing window** — Recruitment may need to be redone
- **Expired certification** — The 180-day I-140 filing window is non-negotiable
- **Malpractice risk** — Clients rely on their attorney to manage timelines

When you're managing 10, 20, or 50+ active cases, manual tracking with spreadsheets becomes a liability.

## How PERM Tracker Calculates Deadlines

PERM Tracker uses a rules engine based on 20 CFR 656 to automatically calculate every deadline from the dates you enter. Here's how it works:

### Cascade System

When you enter or update a key date, the system automatically recalculates all dependent deadlines. For example:

1. Enter the **PWD determination date** → System calculates PWD expiration (1 year)
2. Enter the **first recruitment activity date** → System calculates the 180-day filing window
3. Enter the **PERM certification date** → System calculates the 180-day I-140 deadline

This cascade approach means you never need to manually calculate a deadline — just enter dates as they happen.

### Validation Warnings

Beyond deadline calculation, PERM Tracker validates your case data against PERM regulations:

- **Expired PWD warning** — Alerts when a PWD is about to expire or has expired
- **Recruitment completeness** — Flags missing required recruitment activities
- **Filing window status** — Shows whether you're within the valid filing window
- **Timeline conflicts** — Identifies cases where deadlines overlap or conflict

## Setting Up Notifications

PERM Tracker offers three notification channels:

### Email Notifications

Configure email alerts to receive deadline reminders at your preferred advance notice period (7 days, 14 days, 30 days before).

### Push Notifications

Enable browser push notifications for real-time alerts — even when you're not actively using PERM Tracker.

### Dashboard Indicators

The Dashboard uses color-coded urgency indicators:

- **Green** — Plenty of time remaining
- **Blue** — Approaching (weeks away)
- **Orange** — Soon (days away)
- **Red** — Urgent or overdue

## Calendar View

The Calendar view shows all deadlines across all cases in a familiar monthly/weekly format. This is especially useful for:

- **Identifying deadline clusters** — Weeks with multiple deadlines
- **Planning workload** — Scheduling case work around upcoming deadlines
- **Client communication** — Sharing timeline visibility with clients

## Timeline View

For a big-picture view, the Timeline shows all your cases on a Gantt-chart style timeline. Each case is represented as a horizontal bar, with key milestones marked along the way.

This view helps you:

- See where each case stands relative to others
- Identify bottlenecks across your caseload
- Plan staffing and resource allocation

## Best Practices

1. **Enter dates immediately** — Don't wait to update your tracking system
2. **Review the Calendar weekly** — Catch upcoming deadlines before they become urgent
3. **Enable multiple notification channels** — Email + push for redundancy
4. **Use the Dashboard daily** — The urgency indicators make it easy to prioritize
