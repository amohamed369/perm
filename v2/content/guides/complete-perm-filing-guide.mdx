## Overview

This guide covers the complete PERM labor certification process from start to finish. Whether you're filing your first PERM case or your hundredth, this reference provides the regulatory framework, practical tips, and timeline expectations for each stage.

## Stage 1: Prevailing Wage Determination

### What It Is

Before any recruitment activity, the employer must obtain a prevailing wage determination (PWD) from the DOL's National Prevailing Wage Center (NPWC). The PWD establishes the minimum salary that must be offered for the position.

### How to File

1. Submit Form ETA-9141 to the NPWC
2. Include the detailed job description and requirements
3. Specify the SOC code for the position
4. Indicate the work location (metropolitan statistical area)

### Key Considerations

- **Processing time**: 6-12 months currently
- **Validity**: 1 year from determination date
- **Wage levels**: DOL assigns Level I-IV based on job requirements
- **Reconsideration**: Employers can request reconsideration within 30 days

<Callout type="important" title="Critical Deadline">
The PWD must be valid at the time of PERM filing. Start the PWD process early to avoid timing issues.
</Callout>

## Stage 2: Recruitment

### Required Activities

All PERM cases require these recruitment activities:

1. **State Workforce Agency (SWA) Job Order** — 30-day posting
2. **Two Sunday newspaper advertisements** — In the area of intended employment
3. **Internal job posting** — 10 consecutive business days at the worksite

### Professional Occupations (Additional Requirements)

For positions requiring a bachelor's degree or higher, three additional recruitment steps are required from this list:

- Job fairs
- Employer's website posting
- Job search websites
- On-campus recruiting
- Trade or professional organizations
- Private employment firms
- Employee referral programs
- Campus placement offices
- Local/ethnic newspapers
- Radio/television advertisements

### Recruitment Timing

- All recruitment must be completed within **180 days before filing**
- A **30-day waiting period** is required after the last recruitment activity
- Recruitment results must be documented before filing

### Documentation Requirements

Maintain complete records of:
- All advertisements and postings (with dates)
- Applicant resumes and contact information
- Interview notes and evaluations
- Lawful job-related reasons for rejecting U.S. applicants
- Recruitment report summarizing results

## Stage 3: ETA Form 9089

### Preparation

The ETA 9089 is the actual PERM application. Before filing:

- Verify all recruitment is complete and documented
- Confirm the PWD is still valid
- Ensure the offered wage meets or exceeds the prevailing wage
- Review all job requirements for consistency with recruitment materials

### Filing

File electronically through the DOL's PERM Online System (FLAG). The system assigns a case number upon submission.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Inconsistencies between the job posting and the 9089
- Job requirements that don't match the prevailing wage level
- Missing or incomplete employer information
- Errors in the beneficiary's education or experience history

## Stage 4: DOL Processing

### Possible Outcomes

1. **Certification** — Application approved
2. **Audit** — DOL requests additional documentation
3. **Supervised recruitment** — DOL oversees a new recruitment process
4. **Denial** — Application rejected (with appeal rights)

### Audit Response

If audited, you typically have 30 days to respond. Prepare your documentation proactively:

- Complete recruitment file
- Business necessity letters (if applicable)
- Evidence of bona fide job opportunity
- Any additional documentation requested

## Stage 5: Post-Certification

### I-140 Filing Deadline

Upon certification, the employer has **180 calendar days** to file the I-140 immigrant petition with USCIS. This is a strict deadline — there are no extensions.

### What to File

- Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers
- Certified ETA 9089
- Evidence of the employer's ability to pay the offered wage
- Evidence of the beneficiary's qualifications

### Priority Date

The priority date is the date the PERM application was filed with the DOL. This date determines the beneficiary's place in line for an immigrant visa.
