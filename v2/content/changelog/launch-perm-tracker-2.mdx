## PERM Tracker 2.0 is Here

After months of development, we're excited to launch PERM Tracker 2.0 — a complete rebuild of the original PERM case tracking tool, now with real-time data, automated calculations, and a modern interface designed for immigration attorneys.

## What's New in 2.0

### Real-Time Case Tracking

Every change is synced instantly across devices. No more stale data or manual refresh buttons. Your case status is always current.

### Automated Deadline Engine

Based on 20 CFR 656, PERM Tracker automatically calculates every critical deadline:

- PWD expiration dates
- Recruitment activity windows
- ETA 9089 filing windows
- I-140 180-day filing deadlines

Enter key dates, and the system handles the math.

### Cascade Updates

When you update a key date, all dependent deadlines recalculate automatically. Change the PWD determination date? Every downstream deadline updates instantly.

### Recruitment Tracking

A built-in checklist tracks all required recruitment activities with date validation, timing checks, and compliance verification.

### Calendar & Timeline Views

Two powerful views for managing your caseload:

- **Calendar** — All deadlines in a familiar monthly/weekly format
- **Timeline** — Gantt-chart style view across multiple cases

### Multi-Channel Notifications

Never miss a deadline with:

- Email alerts
- Browser push notifications
- Dashboard urgency indicators

### AI Assistant

Ask questions about PERM regulations, get case-specific guidance, and explore the knowledge base — right within the app.

### Progressive Web App

Install PERM Tracker as a native app on your phone or desktop. Works offline for viewing, syncs when connected.

## What's Coming

We're just getting started. Here's what's on the roadmap:

- **Content hub** — Blog, tutorials, and guides for PERM practitioners
- **Bulk operations** — Manage multiple cases simultaneously
- **Advanced analytics** — Processing time trends, audit risk indicators
- **Team features** — Multi-attorney case collaboration

## Free Forever

PERM Tracker is free. No trial period, no premium tier, no hidden costs. We built this tool because PERM case management shouldn't require expensive software.
