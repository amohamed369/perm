## What's New

### Visual Refresh

We've completely refreshed the visual design of PERM Tracker with a bold neobrutalist aesthetic:

- **Custom SVG illustrations** throughout the app — from the landing page to empty states
- **Animated decorative elements** — floating icons, parallax effects, and scroll-triggered animations
- **High-quality photography** — professional images replacing placeholder graphics
- **Improved dark mode** — refined color palette with better contrast and readability

### Mobile Experience

The mobile experience has been significantly improved:

- **Responsive date inputs** — no more overflow on small screens
- **Touch-optimized controls** — 44px minimum touch targets throughout
- **Better navigation** — streamlined mobile menu with smooth transitions

### Performance

- **Faster page loads** — optimized image delivery and lazy loading
- **Service worker caching** — key assets cached for instant return visits
- **Reduced bundle size** — tree-shaking and code splitting improvements

## Coming Soon

- **Content hub** — Blog, tutorials, and guides for PERM practitioners
- **AI-powered insights** — Smart suggestions based on your case data
- **Bulk case operations** — Manage multiple cases simultaneously
