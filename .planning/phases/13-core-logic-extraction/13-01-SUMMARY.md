# Phase 13 Plan 01: BUSINESS_RULES.md Extraction Summary

**Comprehensive PERM business rules document (1810 lines) covering 4-step process, 14 case stages, auto-calculations, Either/Or rule, professional occupation requirements, and all 50+ fields with TypeScript pseudocode**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 11 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-20T18:35:24Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-20T18:46:52Z
- **Tasks:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created V2_BUSINESS_RULES.md as standalone migration-ready reference (1810 lines)
- Documented 4-step PERM process with timelines and regulatory citations
- Cataloged all 14 case stages with auto-determination algorithm in TypeScript pseudocode
- Extracted all auto-calculated field formulas (PWD expiration, ETA 9089 expiration, etc.)
- Explained Either/Or rule (20 CFR § 656.40(c)) with both valid paths
- Documented professional occupation requirements with all 10 recruitment methods
- Created feature cross-reference to V2_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/V2_BUSINESS_RULES.md` - Created (1810 lines)
  - Section 1: PERM Process Overview (4-step process, timeline)
  - Section 2: Case Stage Progression (14 stages, transitions, auto-determination)
  - Section 3: Auto-Calculated Fields (PWD exp, recruitment end, ETA exp, I-140 deadline)
  - Section 4: Either/Or Rule (20 CFR § 656.40(c))
  - Section 5: Case Field Reference (50+ fields with types)
  - Section 6: Date Validation Rules (PWD, recruitment, ETA, I-140, RFI/RFE)
  - Section 7: Professional Occupation Rules (3 of 10 methods, 30-day rule)
  - Section 8: Feature Cross-Reference
  - Section 9: Terminal States
  - Section 10: Deadline Relevance Logic
  - Appendices: Regulatory references, processing times, migration notes

## Decisions Made

- Used TypeScript-style pseudocode for all calculation formulas (matches v2.0 target stack)
- Organized document by functionality rather than by source file for migration clarity
- Included all 14 stages (11 active + 3 terminal) for completeness
- Added validation rules to business rules doc rather than separate file since they're interconnected

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Step

Ready for 13-02-PLAN.md (DEADLINE_FLOWS.md extraction)
