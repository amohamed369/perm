# Phase 18.1 Plan 01: Auth Structure & Form Styling Summary

**V1-style brutalist auth pages with BLACK header/footer, Forest Green logo button, proper z-index stacking, and mobile-responsive navigation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~25 min (including revision to match v1)
- **Started:** 2025-12-23T03:50:40Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-23T05:25:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2 + revision pass
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments

- Redesigned header to match v1: BLACK background with Forest Green logo button
- Redesigned footer to match v1: BLACK background with white centered text
- Fixed z-index stacking issues (grain overlay was z-9999, now z-1)
- Made navigation mobile-responsive (visible on all screen sizes)
- Used Next.js `<Link>` components for client-side navigation
- Applied brutalist typography: uppercase labels, mono font, bold, tracking-widest
- Uppercase button text throughout (SIGN IN, SIGN UP, etc.)
- 2px black border dividers with proper spacing

## Files Created/Modified

- `v2/src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - BLACK header/footer, Forest Green logo button, Next.js Links, mobile-responsive nav
- `v2/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Brutalist label styling, uppercase buttons, 2px dividers
- `v2/src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` - Same styling for credentials and verification steps
- `v2/src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx` - Same styling for email and reset steps
- `v2/src/app/globals.css` - Fixed grain-overlay z-index (9999 → 1)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| BLACK header/footer (not white) | Matches v1 brutalist design |
| Forest Green logo as button | V1 pattern: logo is interactive element with hard shadow |
| Nav visible on mobile | Accessibility - no hamburger needed for 2 links |
| Grain overlay z-index: 1 | Decorative layer shouldn't block interactions |
| Header/footer z-index: 20 | Sticky elements must stay above content (z-10) |

## Code Review Fixes

- Replaced `<a>` tags with Next.js `<Link>` for client-side navigation
- Made navigation visible on all screen sizes (was `hidden sm:flex`)
- Added responsive padding/text sizing for mobile

## Issues Encountered

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Header clickable area moved on scroll | Fixed z-index hierarchy (grain was 9999) |
| Header went behind content | Increased header z-index to 20 |
