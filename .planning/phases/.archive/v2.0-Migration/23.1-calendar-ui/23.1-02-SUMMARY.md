## Accomplishments

- Created CalendarView component with react-big-calendar integration and neobrutalist CSS overrides
- Built custom CalendarToolbar with month/week/day view toggles and navigation buttons
- Built CalendarEvent component with stage color dots and urgency border indicators
- Created CalendarEventPopover (Dialog-based) showing deadline type, date, employer, beneficiary, position, urgency badge
- Added "View Case" navigation button and "Hide from Calendar" preference update
- Integrated popover with CalendarView state management (selected event, open/close)
- Updated calendar/page.tsx to pass caseDataMap and hiddenCases for popover display

## Files Created/Modified

- `v2/src/components/calendar/CalendarView.tsx` - Main calendar wrapper with react-big-calendar, CSS overrides, popover state
- `v2/src/components/calendar/CalendarToolbar.tsx` - Custom neobrutalist toolbar with navigation and view toggles
- `v2/src/components/calendar/CalendarEvent.tsx` - Custom event component with stage dot and urgency border
- `v2/src/components/calendar/CalendarEventPopover.tsx` - Dialog popover showing full case details with actions
- `v2/src/components/calendar/index.ts` - Barrel exports for calendar components
- `v2/src/app/(authenticated)/calendar/page.tsx` - Updated to pass caseDataMap and hiddenCases to CalendarView
- `v2/src/app/(authenticated)/calendar/loading.tsx` - Suspense skeleton matching calendar layout

## Decisions Made

- **Dialog over Popover for event details:** Used Radix Dialog instead of Popover for touch-friendly accessibility (click-based, not hover)
- **CaseDataMap pattern:** Pass case data as Map for O(1) lookup in popover instead of querying on each click
- **CSS-in-JSX global styles:** Used styled-jsx global for react-big-calendar overrides to keep styling co-located with component
