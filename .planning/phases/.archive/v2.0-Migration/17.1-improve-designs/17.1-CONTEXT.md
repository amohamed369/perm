# Phase 17.1: Improve Designs - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

> **CRITICAL FOR ALL AGENTS/SUBAGENTS:** Before ANY implementation work on this phase, you MUST read:
> - `.planning/FRONTEND_DESIGN_SKILL.md` — frontend-design skill (its a plug-in) - Design philosophy and approach
> - `.planning/phases/17-design-system/design1` through `design5` — Design reference examples
> - `.planning/V2_DESIGN_TOKENS.json` — Established design tokens

## How This Should Work

Take the existing Phase 17 components and close the gap between them and the design mockups (design1-5). This is NOT a redesign — it's a polish pass. Small, targeted improvements that make the components feel more like the mockups: more texture, more depth, more character.

The goal is to make someone look at the components and think "yes, this matches the vision" without rebuilding everything from scratch.

**Key reference:** Design4 is the favorite — the fonts, colors, skeleton states, and especially the hover animation on the stage progression ("01. FILED" with expanding underline).

**Design examples location:** `.planning/phases/17-design-system/design1` through `design5`

## What Must Be Nailed (8 Items)

### Core Visual Identity
1. **Badge 3D shadow** — Status badges need `box-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000` to pop. Currently flat, need that neobrutalist depth. (All designs)

2. **Grain overlay** — Subtle SVG noise texture at ~4% opacity, fixed overlay across the app. Gives depth and character. (design2, design3, design4, design5)

3. **Dot/mesh background** — Radial gradient dot pattern behind pages. Different from grain — this is structural texture. (design1, design2, design3)

### Design System Primitives
4. **Skeleton loading component** — Proper shimmer animation like design4's `skeleton-pulse`. Design system primitive with variants (line, block, circle). (All designs)

5. **Dark variant cards** — Black background card option with white text for contrast sections. See design4's "Animation Strategy" card and design5's dark panels. (design4, design5)

6. **Industrial line dividers** — Styled `<hr>` elements with the neobrutalist treatment. Simple but consistent. (design5)

### Typography
7. **JetBrains Mono for technical labels** — Monospace font consistently used for case numbers, dates, codes, status labels. Add `.mono` utility class. (All designs)

### Signature Interaction
8. **Stage progression hover effect** — The "01. FILED" + expanding underline from design4. Line grows from `w-0` to `w-full` on hover with `transition-all duration-500`. This is the signature interaction — user's favorite. (design4)

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope (Deferred)

### Deferred to Phase 20 (Dashboard)
- **Hazard stripes** — Yellow/black diagonal pattern for footers/dividers
- **Corner label component** — Numbered box in top-right of cards (`01`, `02`)

### Deferred to Phase 25 (Settings)
- **Knob/slider controls** — Custom slider UI with handles (design5's "HOVER TENSION" control)

### Deferred to Phase 18+ (When Modals Needed)
- **Glass panel effect** — Backdrop blur for modals/overlays

### Deferred to Phase 26 (Chat Foundation)
- **Typing cursor animation** — Green blinking cursor for chatbot UI

### Deferred to Post-MVP
- **Bouncing animated elements** — Decorative, better for landing pages
- **Dotted borders inside cards** — May revisit if cards feel too plain
- **Clip-path shapes** — Angled polygon cutoffs (decorative)

</boundaries>

### CSS Patterns from Designs

**Badge shadow (all designs):**
```css
box-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000;
```

**Grain overlay (design2, design4, design5):**
```css
.grain-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 9999;
  opacity: 0.04;
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 200 200' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cfilter id='noiseFilter'%3E%3CfeTurbulence type='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='0.65' numOctaves='3' stitchTiles='stitch'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23noiseFilter)'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
}
```

**Dot/mesh background (design1, design3):**
```css
background-image: radial-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 1px, transparent 1px);
background-size: 24px 24px;
```

**Skeleton shimmer (design4):**
```css
.skeleton-pulse {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #eeeeee 25%, #dddddd 50%, #eeeeee 75%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  animation: skeleton-move 1.5s infinite;
}
@keyframes skeleton-move {
  0% { background-position: 200% 0; }
  100% { background-position: -200% 0; }
}
```

**Stage hover effect (design4):**
```html
<div class="group cursor-pointer">
  <div class="stage-tag bg-[#0066FF] mb-2">PWD Phase</div>
  <div class="text-2xl font-bold mono group-hover:text-[#0066FF] transition-colors">01. FILED</div>
  <div class="w-0 group-hover:w-full h-1 bg-[#0066FF] transition-all duration-500 mt-1"></div>
</div>
```

**Dark card variant (design4, design5):**
```css
.card-dark {
  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
  border: 2px solid #000;
}
```

<notes>
## Additional Context

**User's philosophy:** "I don't want a massive overhaul. I just want to take what we can and fit and change little things to make it better."

**Estimated effort:** ~1.5-2 hours for 8 targeted improvements

**Human Checkpoint:** YES — must approve the polished components before Phase 18

**Design4 is the favorite** — pay special attention to:
- Fonts and colors (Space Grotesk + JetBrains Mono + Inter)
- Skeleton loading states
- The hover animation on "01. FILED", "02. ACTIVE" etc.
