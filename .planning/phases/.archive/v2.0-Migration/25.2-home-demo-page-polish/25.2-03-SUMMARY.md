# Phase 25.2 Plan 03: Home Page Completion Summary

**FAQ accordion with 6 PERM questions, validated contact form with mailto fallback, extended footer with navigation, grain overlay and scroll-based parallax shapes**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 89 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-01T19:21:02Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-01T20:50:09Z
- **Tasks:** 4 (3 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Built FAQ accordion with 6 expandable PERM-related questions using custom React state management and CSS grid-rows animation
- Created contact section with validated form (name, email, message) and mailto: fallback submission
- Extended Footer component with variant prop ('compact' | 'extended') for public vs authenticated pages
- Added grain overlay and 3 parallax floating shapes with scroll-responsive movement
- Full accessibility support (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, prefers-reduced-motion)

## Files Created/Modified

- `v2/src/components/home/FAQSection.tsx` - Accordion FAQ with 6 PERM Q&A, keyboard accessible, smooth animations
- `v2/src/components/home/ContactSection.tsx` - Contact form with validation + 2 link cards (Email Support, Documentation)
- `v2/src/components/home/DecorativeElements.tsx` - Grain overlay + 3 parallax floating shapes with scroll-based movement
- `v2/src/components/home/index.ts` - Barrel exports for all home components
- `v2/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - Added variant prop for extended footer on public pages
- `v2/src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` - Integrated decorative elements and extended footer

## Decisions Made

- Used custom accordion implementation with React state instead of shadcn/ui (lighter weight, simpler)
- Used CSS `grid-rows-[1fr]/grid-rows-[0fr]` pattern for smooth height animation (more performant than max-height)
- Implemented scroll-based parallax instead of mouse-based (simpler, works on all devices)
- Used mailto: fallback for contact form (no backend required for MVP)
- Hidden parallax shapes on mobile (<768px) for performance optimization

## Issues Encountered

- User made some manual edits during verification - approved after adjustments

## Next Phase Readiness

- Home page is now complete with all v1 sections preserved
- Ready for 25.2-04-PLAN.md (Demo Page Core)
