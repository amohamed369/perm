## Instructions for All Agents, Plans, and Execution

### Core Philosophy
- **DRY, KISS** — No duplication, minimal complexity
- **Performance first** — Fast loading is critical, animations must be lightweight
- **Work within existing patterns** — Use v2 design system as-is, no new tokens
- **Explore first** — Fully understand before implementing
- **No clashing implementations** — Seamless integration with existing code

### Required Reading (MUST read before any implementation)
1. `.planning/FRONTEND_DESIGN_SKILL.md` — Frontend design patterns
2. `.planning/phases/17-design-system/design*` — Design docs 1-4
3. `perm_flow.md` — Case statuses, progress statuses, stage transitions
4. `v2/src/app/globals.css` — Existing animations and utilities
5. `v2/src/components/ui/` — Existing component patterns

### Implementation Rules
1. Use existing CSS animation utilities from globals.css
2. No new colors, shadows, or typography tokens
3. No new border-radius (system is square-corners only)
4. Keep code clean, organized, maintainable, readable
5. Ensure no clashing or duplicate implementations
6. Make fixes global — don't repeat patterns
7. Refactor as needed to fit fixes or improve maintainability
8. Abstract-able, scalable, DRY throughout

### Performance Requirements
- Animations must be CSS-based where possible (not JS-driven)
- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize images (use next/image)
- Reduce motion on mobile for battery/performance
- Code split aggressively
- No blocking renders

### Quality Standards
- All features from v1 must be preserved
- Mobile responsive on all pages
- Dark mode support
- Touch-optimized on mobile
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)

**Prior context from 25.2-01:**
- ScrollReveal component created
- Animation utilities in v2/src/lib/animations.ts
- (public) route group layout established
- Hero section complete

**V1 features to preserve:**
- Feature grid (3 cards)
- How It Works (3 steps)
- Feature showcase (6 items, staggered)
- AI features integrated naturally (not separate section)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build Features Grid section (3 cards)</name>
  <files>v2/src/components/home/FeaturesGrid.tsx</files>
  <exploration>
    Use Explore agent to check v1's feature grid structure (frontend/public/index.html or frontend/index.html).
    Review existing Card component patterns in v2/src/components/ui/card.tsx.
    Check ScrollReveal component created in 25.2-01.
  </exploration>
  <action>
    Create FeaturesGrid.tsx with 3 feature cards:

    1. Card 1: "Smart Deadline Tracking"
       - Icon: Calendar/clock icon
       - Description: Automatic deadline calculations per DOL regulations

    2. Card 2: "Real-Time Updates"
       - Icon: Refresh/sync icon
       - Description: Instant status updates across all devices

    3. Card 3: "AI-Powered Assistant"
       - Icon: Chat/sparkles icon
       - Description: Natural language case management (integrate AI naturally)

    Implementation:
    - Use existing Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent components
    - Apply .card-snappy class for hover lift
    - Hard shadow styling (--shadow-hard)
    - Icons: Use lucide-react icons (already in project)
    - ScrollReveal wrapper with stagger delay (0, 100ms, 200ms)
    - Grid: 3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile
    - Dark mode: CSS variables handle automatically

    Fresh copy per CONTEXT.md - write compelling, not generic.
  </action>
  <verify>pnpm build succeeds, component renders without errors</verify>
  <done>Features grid with 3 cards, staggered scroll reveal, responsive layout</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build How It Works section (3 steps)</name>
  <files>v2/src/components/home/HowItWorks.tsx</files>
  <exploration>
    Check v1 structure for How It Works section.
    Look for numbered step patterns in design docs.
  </exploration>
  <action>
    Create HowItWorks.tsx with 3 numbered steps:

    1. Step 1: "Add Your Cases"
       - Number in corner accent box
       - Description: Import existing or create new PERM cases

    2. Step 2: "Track Deadlines"
       - Number in corner accent box
       - Description: Automated PWD, recruitment, ETA 9089, I-140 deadlines

    3. Step 3: "Stay Compliant"
       - Number in corner accent box
       - Description: Never miss a filing window or deadline again

    Implementation:
    - Section header: "How It Works" (Space Grotesk, bold)
    - 3-column grid on desktop, stacked on mobile
    - Corner accent boxes with step numbers (1, 2, 3)
       - Use existing corner-accent pattern or create simple numbered box
       - Black background, white text (inverts in dark mode)
    - ScrollReveal with center threshold (40-50%)
    - Stagger cascade: steps reveal one by one
    - Connector lines between steps (optional, CSS ::after pseudo-elements)
  </action>
  <verify>pnpm build succeeds, section renders with numbered steps</verify>
  <done>How It Works with 3 numbered steps, scroll reveal, responsive</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Build Feature Showcase section (6 items)</name>
  <files>v2/src/components/home/FeatureShowcase.tsx</files>
  <exploration>
    Check v1 feature showcase for 6 items and their descriptions.
    Review the stagger animation patterns from CONTEXT.md.
  </exploration>
  <action>
    Create FeatureShowcase.tsx with 6 showcase items:

    1. "PWD Expiration Tracking" - Per 20 CFR 656.40 compliance
    2. "Recruitment Period Management" - All 7 methods tracked
    3. "Filing Window Calculator" - 30-180 day windows
    4. "RFI/RFE Alerts" - Never miss a response deadline
    5. "Calendar Integration" - Google Calendar two-way sync
    6. "Case Timeline View" - Visual progress tracking

    Implementation:
    - Section header: "Everything You Need" or similar
    - 2-column grid on desktop, 1 on mobile
    - Each item: Icon + title + description
    - Use existing Badge component for category tags if appropriate
    - Icons from lucide-react
    - ScrollReveal with staggered cascade:
       - Items reveal one-by-one (100ms delay between each)
       - Use staggerContainer variant from animations.ts
    - Subtle hover effect (existing hover-lift class)
    - Fresh, compelling copy for each item
  </action>
  <verify>pnpm build succeeds, 6 showcase items render with stagger</verify>
  <done>Feature showcase with 6 items, staggered reveal, responsive layout</done>
