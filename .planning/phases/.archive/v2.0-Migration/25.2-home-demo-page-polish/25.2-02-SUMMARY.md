# Phase 25.2 Plan 02: Home Page Sections Summary

**FeaturesGrid (3 cards), HowItWorks (3 numbered steps), and FeatureShowcase (6 items) with staggered scroll reveal animations**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 13 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-01T19:02:23Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-01T19:15:53Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Created FeaturesGrid component with 3 feature cards (Smart Deadline Tracking, Real-Time Updates, AI-Powered Assistant)
- Created HowItWorks component with 3 numbered steps using existing CornerLabel component
- Created FeatureShowcase component with 6 PERM-specific feature items
- All components use ScrollReveal with staggered delays for smooth entrance animations
- Responsive layouts: 3-column → 1-column (FeaturesGrid, HowItWorks), 2-column → 1-column (FeatureShowcase)

## Files Created/Modified

- `v2/src/components/home/FeaturesGrid.tsx` - 3-card grid with Card components, lucide icons, ScrollReveal with 0/0.1s/0.2s stagger
- `v2/src/components/home/HowItWorks.tsx` - 3 numbered steps using CornerLabel for corner numbers, bg-muted/30 section
- `v2/src/components/home/FeatureShowcase.tsx` - 6-item showcase with simpler flex layout, hover effects

## Decisions Made

- Used existing CornerLabel component for numbered step badges (discovered during exploration)
- FeatureShowcase uses simpler flex layout vs full Card components (per plan guidance: "feature bullets not full cards")
- Section backgrounds alternate: transparent (Features) → bg-muted/30 (HowItWorks) → bg-muted/30 (Showcase) for visual rhythm
- Fresh, PERM-specific copy for all content (not generic marketing language)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Step

Ready for 25.2-03-PLAN.md (Home Page Completion - integration of sections into page.tsx)
