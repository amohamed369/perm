# Phase 25.2 Context: Home & Demo Page Polish

## Vision Summary

**Two production-quality public pages** with v1 feature parity + v2 polish. The goal is a premium, professional, yet fun experience that makes PERM tracking feel less tedious while showcasing serious software for real attorneys.

**Performance is the #1 priority** — this applies to the entire app, all pages and functions.

## CRITICAL: Cascading Context Block

**This section MUST be included in:**
1. Every PLAN.md created for this phase
2. Every subagent prompt (explore and task agents)
3. Referenced by all execution phases

```xml
<CASCADING_CONTEXT>
## Instructions for All Agents, Plans, and Execution

### Core Philosophy
- **DRY, KISS** — No duplication, minimal complexity
- **Performance first** — Fast loading is critical, animations must be lightweight
- **Work within existing patterns** — Use v2 design system as-is, no new tokens
- **Explore first** — Fully understand before implementing
- **No clashing implementations** — Seamless integration with existing code

### Required Reading (MUST read before any implementation)
1. `.planning/FRONTEND_DESIGN_SKILL.md` — frontend-design skill (its a plug-in) - Frontend design patterns
2. `.planning/phases/17-design-system/design*` — Design docs 1-4
3. `perm_flow.md` — Case statuses, progress statuses, stage transitions
4. `v2/src/app/globals.css` — Existing animations and utilities
5. `v2/src/components/ui/` — Existing component patterns

### Implementation Rules
1. Use existing CSS animation utilities from globals.css
2. No new colors, shadows, or typography tokens
3. No new border-radius (system is square-corners only)
4. Keep code clean, organized, maintainable, readable
5. Ensure no clashing or duplicate implementations
6. Make fixes global — don't repeat patterns
7. Refactor as needed to fit fixes or improve maintainability
8. Abstract-able, scalable, DRY throughout

### Performance Requirements
- Animations must be CSS-based where possible (not JS-driven)
- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize images (use next/image)
- Reduce motion on mobile for battery/performance
- Code split aggressively
- No blocking renders

### Quality Standards
- All features from v1 must be preserved
- Mobile responsive on all pages
- Dark mode support
- Touch-optimized on mobile
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)

### Hero Image Requirement
- **MUST USE:** `v2/public/images/hero-showcase.png` (isometric UI showcase)
- Optimize to WebP with responsive sizes (lg/md/sm)
- Use next/image with priority loading
- Target < 200KB per optimized version

## User's Vision

### First Impression (First 3 Seconds)
All of the above — balanced:
- "Wow, this is premium" — sleek, polished, feels like paid SaaS (but free)
- "This is serious software" — professional, trustworthy, built for real attorneys
- "This looks fun to use" — playful energy, inviting
- "Clean and fast" — minimal, gets to the point

### Visual Style
**Hybrid approach:**
- Hero section: Dramatic, bolder, statement piece
- Rest of page: Consistent with app's neobrutalist style (hard shadows, square corners)

### Motion & Animation Philosophy
**Mix of all, with emphasis on snappy & reactive FIRST:**

| Context | Motion Style |
|---------|--------------|
| Content reveals | Subtle & smooth — gentle fades, soft reveals |
| Interactions | Snappy & reactive — Linear.app-style, feels alive |
| Hero section | Dramatic & delightful — memorable moments |
| Everything | Must feel snappy FIRST, then layer other qualities |

**Scroll Animation Behavior (ALL of these):**
- Reveal early (10-20% in view) — content appears as it enters viewport
- Reveal at center (40-50%) — key content when user is focused
- Staggered cascade — elements reveal one-by-one with delays
- Parallax layers — different elements move at different speeds for depth

**Micro-interactions (ALL of these, snappy & responsive, NO pulse animations):**
- Existing v2 patterns (hover lift, press effect)
- More playful hovers (wobble, bounce, color shifts)
- Magnetic cursor effects (elements subtly pull toward cursor like Stripe)

**Inspiration:** Linear.app, GSAP-style smooth animations

### Hero Section Approach
**Replace 3D tilt with something cleaner:**
- Linear-style hero treatment (clean, polished, animated)
- **NOT the 3D tilt effect — feels "corny"**

**REQUIRED HERO IMAGE:**
```
Path: v2/public/images/hero-showcase.png (or .webp after optimization)
```

The hero MUST use the provided isometric showcase image featuring:
- Light/dark mode split design
- Deadline Hub, Calendar view, Timeline view
- Case cards with stage colors (PWD blue, Recruitment purple, ETA orange, I-140 green)
- Isometric 3D perspective
- Dot pattern background
- Professional UI showcase

**Image Optimization Requirements:**
1. Convert to WebP format for web (keep PNG as fallback)
2. Create responsive versions:
   - `hero-showcase-lg.webp` (1920px width, desktop)
   - `hero-showcase-md.webp` (1280px width, tablet)
   - `hero-showcase-sm.webp` (768px width, mobile)
3. Use `next/image` with priority loading (above fold)
4. Add blur placeholder for perceived performance
5. Lazy load on mobile if image is heavy
6. Target: < 200KB for largest version after optimization

**Animation Enhancement (optional):**
- Subtle float animation on the image
- Or parallax effect on scroll
- Keep it lightweight — image is the star

**Note:** Image file needs to be saved to `v2/public/images/` before implementation

### Content & Copy
**Generate fresh copy** — write new compelling copy based on the product, but inspired by and taking from v1 so nothing is missing in v2.

### AI Chatbot Section
**Integrate naturally** — weave AI mentions into other features rather than a separate prominent section. AI is a differentiator but doesn't need its own hero treatment.

### Supporting Content
**Both FAQ and Contact are essential:**
- FAQ answers common questions, builds trust
- Contact form with validation + mailto fallback
- Don't defer these — include in v2

### Demo Page Goals
**All of the above:**
1. "I see exactly how tracking works" — clear CRUD flow
2. "This handles the complexity for me" — showcase deadline calculations, validations
3. "I want to sign up right now" — conversion-focused, leaves them wanting more

---

## Navigation & Layout

### Header Strategy
**Shared header across all pages** with context-appropriate CTAs:
- Public pages (home, demo): Logo + Home + Demo + Sign In + Sign Up + Theme Toggle
- Authenticated pages: Logo + Dashboard + Cases + Calendar + Timeline + Notifications + User Menu + Theme Toggle

**Use existing `AuthHeader` component** — it's already production-ready for public pages.

### Footer
**Shared footer** — use existing Footer component across all pages.

---

## Mobile Experience

**All of these apply to the ENTIRE app (all pages and functionality):**
- Responsive but same experience — everything adapts, same features
- Simplified mobile animations — reduce motion for performance/battery
- Mobile-first hero — simpler, faster treatment on mobile
- Touch-optimized interactions — larger tap targets, swipe gestures where appropriate

---

## Performance (TOP PRIORITY)

**Performance first** — fast loading is critical, animations must be lightweight.

This applies to the **entire app**, not just Phase 25.2:
- CSS-based animations where possible
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Next.js Image optimization
- Reduce motion on mobile
- Aggressive code splitting
- No blocking renders
- Skeleton loading states for async content

---

## Technical Direction

### Pages
1. **Home (`/`)** — SSG, SEO-optimized public landing page
2. **Demo (`/demo`)** — Interactive localStorage-based demo

### Stack Decisions
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Framer Motion | Scroll animations, page transitions, parallax |
| Lottie React | Hero animation (if JSON route chosen) |
| CSS transitions | Micro-interactions (existing utilities) |
| localStorage | Demo case persistence |
| Next.js SSG | Static generation for SEO |
| next/image | Optimized images |

- Scroll reveals (Framer Motion)
- Hero effects
- Parallax layers
- Page transitions
- Mobile-specific behavior

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- `/` home page with all v1 sections (polished)
- `/demo` interactive demo with localStorage CRUD
- All v1 features preserved
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Dark mode support
- Scroll animations throughout (early reveal, center reveal, stagger, parallax)
- Hero with isometric showcase image (provided, optimized for web)
- FAQ accordion
- Contact form with validation
- Mini calendar and timeline in demo
- 5 default demo cases
- Animation storyboard documentation
- Fresh compelling copy (inspired by v1)
- Performance optimization throughout

### Out of Scope
- Backend API changes
- New design system tokens (colors, shadows, typography)
- Blog, pricing, or other marketing pages
- Authenticated pages (already built)
- AI chatbot as separate prominent section (integrate naturally instead)

### Open Questions (To Resolve During Implementation)
1. ~~Hero animation approach~~ — **RESOLVED: Use provided isometric showcase image**
2. Exact scroll animation timing and choreography
3. Magnetic cursor implementation details
4. Hero image animation style (float vs parallax vs static)

### Pre-Implementation Setup Required
1. **Save hero image** to `v2/public/images/hero-showcase.png`
2. **Optimize hero image** — convert to WebP, create responsive sizes
3. Create `v2/public/images/` directory if it doesn't exist
