# Phase 18.1: Auth UI Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

---

## CRITICAL: Design Skill Requirement

> **MANDATORY AT ALL LEVELS**: Anyone working on this phase MUST read and use the frontend-design skill (its a plug-in) before ANY implementation work.
>
> This requirement MUST be propagated through:
> 1. **This CONTEXT.md** - documented here
> 2. **PLAN.md** - explicit instruction in the plan
> 3. **Execute phase** - reminder when executing
> 4. **Subagent/Task prompts** - MUST include in prompt: "Read `.planning/FRONTEND_DESIGN_SKILL.md` before implementation"
>
> **Required Reading (in order):**
> - `.planning/FRONTEND_DESIGN_SKILL.md` - Design patterns and aesthetic guidance
> - `.planning/phases/17-design-system/design3` - Design example 3
> - `.planning/phases/17-design-system/design4` - Design example 4
> - `.planning/phases/17-design-system/design5` - Design example 5
> - `.planning/V2_DESIGN_TOKENS.json` - Established design tokens
> - `v2/docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` - v2 component library reference

## How This Should Work

Auth pages (login, signup, reset-password) should feel like part of the PERM Tracker app — not disconnected landing pages. They keep the **brutalist feel from v1** but are enhanced with **v2 design system polish**.

When someone lands on login or signup, they should immediately recognize the PERM Tracker brand:
- Same header/footer chrome as the rest of the app (consistent site framing)
- Bold, intentional form styling with hard borders and shadows
- High contrast color treatment that says "professional legal software"

The forms themselves use the **GlassPanel component** for that frosted glass container effect, with **Space Grotesk typography** for headings and **hard shadow utilities** from the design system.

The overall vibe: "v1 brutalist confidence + v2 refined polish"

## What Must Be Nailed

All three are equally critical — cannot rank:

- **Site chrome consistency** - Auth pages feel like part of the app, wrapped in the same header/footer
- **Brutalist form aesthetic** - Forms look bold and intentional, not generic Bootstrap/Tailwind defaults
- **Professional credibility** - Auth pages convey trust for attorneys entering sensitive case data

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

No explicit exclusions — open to whatever it takes to make it look right.

Phase 18 already completed auth logic, so this is purely visual/UX polish.

## Specific Ideas

### Design References
Use the Phase 17 design inspiration files as visual reference:
- **design3, design4, design5** are the PRIMARY references
- Apply the neobrutalist patterns from these examples

### Loading & Feedback States (CRITICAL)

Every interaction must have visual feedback:

1. **Button click feedback** - Visual indication that button was clicked
2. **Loading states** - Spinner/indicator while form submits
3. **Skeleton loading** - For any async content on auth pages

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Centralized/abstracted** - Create reusable loading components, not hardcoded per-page
- **Clean code** - Proper abstractions and organization
- **Storybook** - All loading/feedback components documented in Storybook
- **Minimal** - Don't over-engineer, but do it properly

### Mobile Responsive
Auth pages must work well on mobile devices.

### Error States
Validation errors should look intentional and match the brutalist aesthetic — not generic red text.

## Additional Context

### Planning & Execution Propagation

When creating PLAN.md, include explicit instructions:
```
BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Read `.planning/FRONTEND_DESIGN_SKILL.md`
2. Review design examples 3, 4, 5
3. Check v2/docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md for existing components
```

When PLAN.md calls subagents or Task tools, prompts MUST include:
```
"Read `.planning/FRONTEND_DESIGN_SKILL.md` and review `.planning/phases/17-design-system/design3`, `design4`, `design5` before implementation."
```

### Human Checkpoint
This phase has a human checkpoint. User will review auth pages visually before marking complete.

### Design System Components to Use
- `GlassPanel` - Form containers
- Typography utilities (Space Grotesk headings)
- Hard shadow utilities (`shadow-brutal`, etc.)
- Status badges/pills for form states (if applicable)
- Skeleton components for loading states
