# Phase 24.1: API Documentation - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Documentation that serves dual purposes: quick reference lookup for devs who know what they need, AND a learning guide for onboarding. Works equally well for both Claude sessions (fast codebase understanding) and human developers who might join or maintain the project.

The docs should feel comprehensive and professional — industry standard quality. Not minimal "just get it done" documentation, but production-grade reference material that makes the codebase accessible.

## What Must Be Nailed

All three areas are equally critical — can't ship without all being solid:

- **API completeness** - Every Convex function documented with full signatures, params, returns, including internal helpers
- **Pattern clarity** - How things work together: import patterns, auth patterns, error handling, data flows
- **Workflow guidance** - Dev commands, testing approach, common tasks, development setup

Detail level: As detailed as possible for each function. No shortcuts.

## What's Out of Scope

No explicit exclusions — document everything that exists. This is a comprehensive documentation phase.

(User explicitly chose "Nothing specific" when asked about scope boundaries)

## Specific Ideas

Format approach: Use whatever is best on a case-by-case basis, following industry standard practices:

- Table-driven concise format (like existing CLAUDE.md) where appropriate
- Fuller prose explanations with examples where context helps
- JSDoc-style function signatures for API reference sections
- Professional production quality throughout

Audience: Both Claude and human readers should find it equally useful.

## Additional Context

From assumptions discussion:
- Include internal helpers in API.md, not just public API
- Establishes documentation maintenance pattern for Phases 25+
- Three deliverables: v2/CLAUDE.md, v2/docs/API.md, v2/README.md

This phase sets the standard for how documentation is maintained going forward.
