# Phase 25.2 Plan 01: Infrastructure & Hero Summary

**Public route group with production-quality hero section featuring isometric showcase image, scroll animation utilities, and responsive neobrutalist design**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 35 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-01T18:07:52Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-01T18:42:38Z
- **Tasks:** 4 (3 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Created image optimization pipeline with hero-showcase.png (1.03 MB, Next.js auto-optimizes)
- Built reusable ScrollReveal component with Framer Motion for scroll-triggered animations
- Created animation utilities library with fade variants, stagger patterns, and parallax helpers
- Implemented (public) route group layout with AuthHeader, Footer, and bg-dots pattern
- Built dramatic hero section with Linear-style treatment (not corny 3D tilt)
- Added reduced motion support throughout for accessibility

## Files Created/Modified

- `v2/public/images/hero-showcase.png` - Isometric UI showcase image (copied from root)
- `v2/src/lib/animations.ts` - Animation variants and utilities (fadeInUp/Down/Left/Right, stagger, parallax)
- `v2/src/components/ui/scroll-reveal.tsx` - ScrollReveal component with useInView, reduced motion support
- `v2/src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` - Public route group layout (AuthHeader + Footer + bg-dots)
- `v2/src/app/(public)/page.tsx` - Home page rendering HeroSection
- `v2/src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` - Hero section with headline, CTAs, image, animations
- `v2/src/app/globals.css` - Added prefers-reduced-motion media query
- Removed: `v2/src/app/page.tsx` - Old redirect-only page (replaced by route group)

## Decisions Made

- **Next.js auto-optimization instead of manual WebP:** Source PNG (1.03 MB) handled by next/image with responsive sizing - no manual sharp processing needed
- **Float animation over parallax:** Chose subtle 6-second float animation for hero image (lighter weight, works without scroll position tracking)
- **ScrollReveal with useInView:** Built reusable component following existing Framer Motion patterns (motion/react import)
- **Removed old page.tsx:** Replaced redirect-only root page with proper (public) route group structure

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- User made some edits during checkpoint review before approving - specific edits handled by user directly
