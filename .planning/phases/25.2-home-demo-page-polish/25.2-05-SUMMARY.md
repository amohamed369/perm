# Phase 25.2 Plan 05: Demo Page CRUD Summary

**Interactive demo page with full case CRUD (add/edit/delete modals), case cards grid, and conversion CTA with AI teaser**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 42 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-01T21:24:05Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-01T22:06:03Z
- **Tasks:** 3 + human checkpoint
- **Files modified:** 7 (5 created, 2 modified)

## Accomplishments

- DemoCaseCard with stage colors, deadline urgency indicators, edit/delete actions
- DemoCasesGrid with responsive 3-column layout, empty state, AnimatePresence animations
- DemoCaseModal with PERM fields, auto-calculations via applyCascade, progressive section disclosure
- DeleteConfirmDialog with destructive styling and case name display
- DemoCTA conversion section with feature highlights and AI commands teaser
- Full CRUD wiring in demo/page.tsx with localStorage persistence

## Files Created/Modified

- `v2/src/components/demo/DemoCaseCard.tsx` - Simplified case card with stage colors, deadline display, action buttons
- `v2/src/components/demo/DemoCasesGrid.tsx` - Responsive grid container with add button and empty state
- `v2/src/components/demo/DemoCaseModal.tsx` - Add/edit modal with PERM fields and cascade auto-calculations
- `v2/src/components/demo/DeleteConfirmDialog.tsx` - Delete confirmation with Trash2 icon and destructive button
- `v2/src/components/demo/DemoCTA.tsx` - Conversion CTA with feature cards, buttons, AI teaser
- `v2/src/components/demo/index.ts` - Added exports for all new components
- `v2/src/app/(public)/demo/page.tsx` - Fully wired with modal state, handlers, all components integrated

## Decisions Made

- Progressive section disclosure in modal based on case status (PWD always shown, Recruitment when status >= recruitment, etc.)
- Integrated AI commands teaser into DemoCTA rather than separate section (per CONTEXT.md guidance)
- Used useCallback for all handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Stage color header (2px bar) on cards matches existing CaseCard pattern

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all implementations completed successfully with passing build.

## Next Step
