# Phase 25.2 Plan 06: Polish & Performance Summary

**Snappy scroll animations, motion reduction hooks, mobile optimizations, and animation storyboard documentation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3h 25m (includes user verification and manual polish edits)
- **Started:** 2026-01-02T00:01:36Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-02T03:26:59Z
- **Tasks:** 4 (3 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 5 core + user edits

## Accomplishments

- Standardized animation timing with constants (STAGGER_DELAY=0.1s, MAX_DURATION=0.5s)
- Added pageEntrance variants for hero sections with immediate load + staggered children
- Exported useReducedMotion and useIsMobile hooks for reuse across components
- Created mobile-optimized animation variants (faster stagger, smaller transforms, snappier springs)
- Enhanced globals.css motion-reduce media query with comprehensive coverage
- Created v2/docs/ANIMATION_STORYBOARD.md documenting all animations

## Files Created/Modified

- `v2/src/lib/animations.ts` - Added useReducedMotion, useIsMobile hooks, pageEntrance variants, mobile variants, timing constants
- `v2/src/components/ui/scroll-reveal.tsx` - Mobile-aware animations, halved stagger on mobile, design rationale docs
- `v2/src/components/home/DecorativeElements.tsx` - Parallax rationale documentation
- `v2/src/app/globals.css` - Enhanced motion-reduce media query, hover timing reduced to 0.15s
- `v2/docs/ANIMATION_STORYBOARD.md` - NEW: Complete animation catalog with design principles, timing tables, accessibility notes

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| STAGGER_DELAY = 0.1s | Standardized for consistent cascade timing across all grid components |
| Mobile stagger = 0.05s | Half of desktop for snappier sequences on mobile |
| Spring stiffness 600 on mobile | Higher than desktop (500) for quicker response |
| Transform distance 12px on mobile | Half of desktop (24px) to reduce visual travel |
| card-snappy hover = 0.15s | Reduced from 0.2s to meet <0.15s hover response target |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as specified.

## Issues Encountered

None - animation system was already well-structured from previous plans. Polish work focused on standardization, documentation, and mobile optimization.
