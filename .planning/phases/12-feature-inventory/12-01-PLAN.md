<objective>
Verify the feature inventory against the actual codebase and update if gaps are found.

Purpose: Ensure the 229-feature inventory in V2_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md is complete and accurate before the migration begins. Any missing features discovered now will be built in v2.0; any missed here may be lost forever.

Output: Verified V2_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md (updated if gaps found), verification report documenting the audit.

**Prior context:**
- Phase 11 (Cleanup + Git Hygiene) completed - clean codebase ready for inventory
- V2_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md already created with 229 features across 20 categories
- This phase is VERIFICATION, not creation from scratch
- Archiving of old docs already done manually

**Key insight from CONTEXT.md:**
> "The inventory should be something I can reference throughout the migration to answer 'does v1.0 have X?' and later verify 'did we build X in v2.0?'"

**Test worktree context:**
- This is `perm-tracker-test/` worktree on branch `test`
- All verification against LOCAL codebase only

    - backend/app/utils/*.py - Utilities (date validation, deadline relevance)
    - backend/app/schemas/*.py - Pydantic models
    - backend/app/tools/*.py - Chatbot tools

    For each inventory category, verify the features exist in code:
    - Authentication (10 features) - auth.py, dependencies.py
    - Case Management (15 features) - cases.py, case_service.py
    - Date Validation (20 features) - date_validation.py
    - Case Stages (11 features) - case_service.py, schemas

    1. Read each backend module systematically
    2. Cross-reference against V2_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md categories
    3. Note any features that exist in code but NOT in inventory
    4. Note any inventory items that can't be found in code
    5. Create findings list for Task 3

    Focus on WHAT exists (features), not HOW it's implemented (that's Phase 13-14).

  <action>
    Based on findings from Tasks 1 and 2:

    1. If gaps found (features in code but not in inventory):
       - Add missing features to appropriate category in V2_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md
       - Update feature counts in summary table
       - Note additions in verification report

    2. If phantom features found (in inventory but not in code):
       - Document in verification report (may be wishlist items accidentally included)
       - Either remove or mark as "not implemented in v1.0"

    3. Create VERIFICATION_REPORT.md with:
       - Categories verified
       - Gaps found (if any)
       - Phantom features found (if any)
       - Final feature count
       - Confidence level in inventory completeness
       - Recommendation for any follow-up

    4. If NO gaps found:
       - Create brief verification report confirming completeness
       - Note verification methodology
  </action>
  <verify>
    - V2_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md updated (or unchanged if complete)
    - VERIFICATION_REPORT.md created
    - Feature count accurate
